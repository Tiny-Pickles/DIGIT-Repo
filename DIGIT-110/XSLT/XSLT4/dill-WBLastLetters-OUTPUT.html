               On December 19th, 1929 Warren Behrend on his way to join his family 
               for the christmas holiday met a school bus at this place. The bus Made a left
               turn in front of his car without giving the proper signal. Instantly this 
               man decided to run his car off the road bed, though it was slippery, to save these
               children. his car overturned in this effort, killing him instantly 
               </div>
            
            <div class="paras"><span class="lineNum">2</span>
               in my experience, I have never known a finer example of self forget-
               fulness, esteeming the safety of others before oneself. Had he hesitated but
               an instant the tragedy of that fatal day would have been written in deeper lines
               some who are here today in possession of youthful health would almost certainly
               have suffered with him.

            <div class="paras"><span class="lineNum">3</span>
               it is appropriate to this occasion that young people of this
               community pause today to consider his wonderful example of heroic sacrifice.
               Warren's deed is a compelling challenge to every one present, most definitely to 
               every boy and girl in this community to dedicate ourselves to the call of duty 
               andof unselfish service. This deed should, and i confidently trust, will be 
               an inspiration to succeeding generations to respond instantly to the call to
               duty even though it may mean to sacrifice.

            <div class="paras"><span class="lineNum">4</span>
               As you young people look out into the world today the call to 
               unselfish service was never so compelling. Many of the finer things of life are 
               in peril. It is confused, almost hysterical. There is no remedy on earth for 
               these disorders so effectual as deeds not words of kindess, of self forgetfulness,
               and unselfish sacrifice. May we not treasure Warren's heroic deed enacted in our
               midst as a reminder to all future generations that the highest duty is always to 
               others rather than to ourselves.

               This community, the two schools in this immediate neighborhood and 
               more particularly the children whose lives were saved by warren Behrend's heroism,
               with their parents and friends come today to pay respectful tribute to his wonderful

               life crowded as it was with all the rich promise of a most useful and happy
               career, then suddenly ccrowned by sacrificing all to the safety of children,
               though the children themselves were unkown to him.

               If inspired by the sacrifice of this splendid young man, you
               boys and girls will dedicate your lives to the great tasks of life, not
               sparing yourselves but givingg youselves instantly and cheerfully when duty 
               calls, then the beautiful example of this splendid young man will not have 
               been in vein.

               From what we learn of his exalted character we think that we
               would wish nothing better tan that these children spared by his heroic
               decision should contribute something worth while to make the world better.

               It is raining hard and freezing on
               the trees; very beautiful indeed, but not
               so practical for people who would drive
               thier cars on a night like this. I
               hope you had nice weather so
               that you could enjoy driving South
               in the Duesenburg

               Ned Richardson and I have
               both promised each other to drive care-
               fully. and arenothing our parents
               such a promise. You already have
                mine anyway buthere it is again. 
               Don't worry.

               I have a "blind date" for to-
               morrow night in New York. If
               you know what a blind date is
               you will realize that I awaite it
               with fear trembling. The only thing 
               the girl who made the date knows
               about me is that I am 5'8" tall.

               Tomorrow we have 20 minute
               periods and are all through at
               11.30. As I have no classesthe 
               sixth and seventh periods I shall
               be all through at 10.50. This works
               out very well, because Mr.Oatley
               
               
               is leaving at eleven o'clock for
               Springfield in his car. He is going
               to take us unknown along and so that
               gives us plenty of time to get the one
               o'clock out of Springfield. That
               gives Ned a chance to stay off in
               New Haven and gives me a chance
               to see Harriet.

               I'm looking forward to seeing you
               in Charleston soon and it will
               be mighty nice to have the whole family
               together again. I'm telephoning Betty
               Brattontonight find out whether
               she can come and if so when. If she
               
               can come you will have received
               a telegram from me before you get
               this better. I think she is bring another 
               boy and another girl with her. Do 
               you think we can find room for all?

               O.K. Someone may thoughtfully mark- 
               ed the rest wrote in red pencil. Wish 
               I knew who it was so that I could thank

               going home when we all live
               on board her than when in the

                Please dust me a line some
                time and tell me what arrange-
                ments you made about
                daring the La Salle meet
                me in Washington. If
                you haven't done this just say so
                and I'll write Miss Fraters. I
                shall probably write to her anyway as
                I want to be sure the boot for
                the toy is in the car and have
                the wings put  back on again.

                I haven't been able to get in
                touch with Betty Bratton yet 
                but I shall probably phone her
                tonight if I can find out where
                she lives. There is small informal
               
                dance here next Saturday and
                if she has no definite * for
                next december Christmas and might
                be able to go I'll ask her if for
                that no that we can talk over that 
                matter. I think Harriet would like
                it better if I could get someone to
                * * keep her company. I'll write
                you to New York the * * the

                I'll have time to make the enlargements you
                want, but if I do I'll be glad to 
                make them. Enlargements take a lot

                There is not as much snow
                here as there was in Erie, but
                it very cold. The water question
                is getting quite serious here now
                and they are planning to drill a
                number of wells next week. The
                spring at the Eaglehook dried out
                yesterday and so that is the jist
                throws all the more drain on the
                town system.
